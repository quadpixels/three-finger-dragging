0.11.3p11 (2003-07-31)
- When setting the mode byte, don't set bits that the touchpad doesn't
  understand. Those bits are reserved and setting them can lead to
  weird problems, like the left button not working, as reported by
  Miles Lane.
- Replaced a few forgotten hardcoded values with symbolic constants.
- Disable stream mode before trying to identify/initialize the
  touchpad. Otherwise the touchpad can report motion data in the
  middle of the initialization sequence, which will confuse the driver
  and make the initialization fail. (Thanks to Miles Lane for helping
  to debug this problem.)
- Updated COMPATIBILITY file.

0.11.3p10 (2003-07-30)
- Improved support for the old-style synaptics protocol.
- Cleanup: Moved middle mouse button emulation to a separate function.
- Cleanup: Moved finger detection to a separate function.
- More robust resynchronization code, after an idea from Hartwig
  Felger. When we realize we are out of sync, only throw away one
  byte, not all bytes already read from the touchpad.

0.11.3p9: (2003-07-29)
- Added support for the old synaptics protocol. By Hartwig Felger.

0.11.3p8: (2003-07-20)
- From Hartwig Felger:
  * Added "multi-buttons" to the FEATURES list.
  * Updated NEWS file with data from the web page.
  * More robust parsing of the Handlers= line when doing auto detection
    for 2.6 kernels. ("Handlers=event2 js0" should work now.)
  * Updated synclient program to explain that it can't query hardware
    details when using a 2.6 kernel.

0.11.3p7: (2003-07-17)
- Added support for touchpads with "multi buttons". (Hartwig Felger)
- Mention the synclient program in the INSTALL file.
- Updated COMPATIBILITY file.
- Implemented protocol "auto-dev" that automatically tries to find the
  proper device node and protocol for the touchpad. This makes it
  possible to have the same XF86Config file for 2.4 and 2.5 kernels.
  (Hartwig Felger)

0.11.3p6: (2003-07-13)
- Build fix for gentoo linux.
- Longer timeout in the reset sequence. Experience from the 2.5 kernel
  driver has shown that 4 seconds is needed for some touchpads.
- Made horizontal wheel replacement buttons work. (Patch from Hartwig
  Felger.)
- Improved driver initialisation and finalization. From Hartwig
  Felger.
- Reset the touchpad to relative mode when the X server
  terminates. (So that you can run gpm afterwards for example.)
- Implemented install target in the Makefile.

0.11.3p5: (2003-07-08)
- Fixed rare X server hang/crash.

0.11.3p4: (2003-07-05)
- Workaround for an X server bug that could make the X server crash.
- Fixed bug that sometimes incorrectly moved the cursor to the upper
  right corner of the screen.

0.11.3p3: (2003-06-19)
- Added support for linux kernel 2.5.x.

0.11.?
- Updated the synclient program to make it possible to read and write
  the variables in the shared memory area. This means you can change
  parameter settings without restarting the X server.
- More reliable implementation of double click simulation using the up
  button. The old implementation incorrectly generated a single click
  instead of a double click for very short clicks of the up button.
- Configurable timeout (option EmulateMidButtonTime) for middle button
  emulation.
- Better state machine for handling middle mouse button emulation.
  * Clicks shorter than EmulateMidButtonTime are no longer lost.
  * The middle button event is generated as soon as both the left and
    the right buttons are pressed. The old code waited until the
    timeout had passed before even checking if both buttons were
    pressed.
- Makefile improvements:
  * Made it possible to build synclient even if an X source tree is
    not available.
  * Added Makefile dependencies so that things get recompiled when a
    header file is changed.
  * synclient.c now includes synaptics.h instead of duplicating the
    shared memory structure definition.
- The shared memory segment is properly removed when the X server
  exits, so that synclient isn't fooled by a stale segment if the X
  server is later restarted without SHMConfig activated.
- The code that tried to remove any old shared memory segment at
  startup before creating the new segment didn't work. Therefore, X
  server startup failed if the size of the shared segment had changed.
  (Which was very annoying during development.)
- Updated the TODO, PARAMETERS and FEATURES files.

  models with 6 buttons (S. Lehner <sam_x@bluemail.ch>)
